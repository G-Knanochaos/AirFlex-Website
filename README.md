# AirFlex
Note: This git is a fork of the original WCC hackathon 2022 AirFlex project by Gavin-kai Vide and Christopher Vu. This git is what will be used for website deployment

## ABOUT AIRFLEX
Electricity use is on the rise, and 18% of electricity comes from operating our own homes. A significant portion of that electricity, 72% to be exact, is utilized by heating and cooling; to reduce AC usage is to reduce our carbon footprint, electrical usage, and our electrical bill. Reduced utility bills are a homeowner’s dream, but minimizing AC usage in an objective, precise way is difficult as most bills don’t show how much was spent on each utility.
<br />
Our solution, AirFlex, is the one-size-fits-all solution to objectively measure your electrical usage in your pursuit to beat the heat. AirFlex wil take information and use it to calculate an estimated electrical bill; this technology is then used to calculate an optimal AC temperature and hours of usage to meet a monetary goal. AirFlex’s technology is not limited to air conditioners; fans can also be calculated down to the cent. AirFlex also has the capability to store this data and use it to visualize your progress over time to make sure that you keep your electrical output (and bill) low. (This feature has not been fully implemented yet. Graphs are created on matplotlib, but we ran into many roadblocks displaying them.)
<br />
AirFlex was a challenge to construct. Stepping out of data science and back end calculations for Christopher were difficult, and working with a front end for the first time was a new experience for him. The greatest challenge was indubitably connecting the back end to the front end for both team members. Working with a team was in and of itself a challenge as having to communicate complex programming ideas to other people was a completely alien concept to both members, who were both conditioned by years of solo programming.  


## HOW TO INITIATE THE WEBSITE
-Step 1: Make sure to install all requirements (in the requirements.txt file) <br />
-Step 2: Run the main.py file <br />
-Step 3: Go to http://127.0.0.1:7000/ <br />

## FUNCTIONALITY:
-Create accounts using an email and a password. <br />
-Go to 'Air Calculator' to give an estimated bill and give a suggested runtime/temperature for your AC based on a budget. <br />
-Go to 'Fan Calculator' to give the estimated electricity  cost of running a fan that you have. <br />

## LATEST UPDATE:
-Added 'personal settings' section in 'AC Usage Progress' page
